# Project Repository README

Welcome to our project's repository! This document serves as your guide to understanding the resources and components that make up this project. Our project involves interactions with Uniswap V3 pools across multiple blockchains, specifically focusing on the CDFi/USDT token pair.

## Overview

The project is designed to interact with Uniswap V3 pools for the CDFi/USDT pair across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Polygon networks. It includes functionality to fetch current prices from these pools, adjust calculations for token decimals, and handle differences in token pair order across chains.
